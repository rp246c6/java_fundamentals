/**
 * Data Types and Operators Exercise 2: Type conversion and casting
 *
 *      Write the necessary code to demonstrate type conversion:
 *
 *      Widening:
 *      1. Declare and initialize an int with the value 10
 *      2. Declare a double and set it equal to the int
 *      3. Print out the double
 *
 *      Narrowing (with casting):
 *      1. Declare and initialize a new double with the value 10.5
 *      2. Declare a new int and set it equal to the double (make sure to cast the double to an int)
 *      3. Print out the int
 *
 *      Notice how each type is converted. In which direction is information lost?
